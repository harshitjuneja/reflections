What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

On initialising a repo, we make an ordinary folder a repo, which means git can now save metadata about my files and hence generate versions based on commit ids.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area offers us a choice to add more than one commit at once. It's really great how a files are first added to the staging area and then commited all at once.
