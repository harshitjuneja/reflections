When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working on a bigger project with contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that if someone made any changes to the repo. I have my version on my desktop.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - Github to github cloning.
Clone - Github to local machine cloning.
Branches - whenever adding a new feature. Nullifies risk of code being fragile.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So by this we can extend the changes we want to after the last commit present at the remote github server.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Would be really difficuilt to add new features. Code review will be hard.
