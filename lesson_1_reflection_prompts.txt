How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 Didn't have to check the code line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

 Can switch back to the best parts of all time. Everytime.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

 Pros: 
 1. No small changes
 2. Less no. of files at hand to compare.
 3. No compile time errors for saved versions
 4. Just what u want

 Cons:

 1. Forgetting to commit is a disaster.
 2. No timely saved files when exiting.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git offers flexibility and ease of use. Made just right for the programmer.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Anytime switch the previous correct version of files I want. Know where & in which commit I made the error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Every code I write
